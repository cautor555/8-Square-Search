# 8-Square-Search

This project was completed for my college artificial intelligence course. The objective of the project was to implement Breadth first search and A* search algorithms to find a solution to the 8-square puzzle and compare the effectiveness of each algorithm. 

Note: two versions of A* search were implemented using different heuristics h1 and h2. H1 counted the number of squares out of place from the goal state. H2 took the sum of the manhattan distance for each square from its spot in the goal state.
